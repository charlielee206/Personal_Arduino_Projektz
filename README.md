# Personal_Arduino_Projektz
Simple, one-off Arduino projects that are too minor for their own repo. 
Things like demo projects, proof of concepts, 30-minute projects, and prototypes that eventually became the full product.
Code optimization, documentation, feedback, updates or imporvements basically don't exist for these.

Uploading in case I need to revive a dead project, perform heart surgery on another project.
Maybe someday someone will stumble upon this dump and find something useful.

# List Of Projects
**Makeshift Sound Voltex clone controller** </br>
A makeshift controller for pc-based rythm games. Made with [this](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone) in mind, but will work with any game that has keyboard input. </br></br>
