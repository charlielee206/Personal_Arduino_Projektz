This is basically a Copy-Paste of two projects:</br>
"Arduino PS2 Mouse to Amiga Adapter" by glitterkitty</br>
https://github.com/glitterkitty/Arduino-PS2-Mouse-to-Amiga-Adapter</br>

and "mac plus ps2" by trekawek.</br>
https://github.com/trekawek/mac-plus-ps2</br>

I only changed the pinouts and merged the two sketches.</br>
All credit for the sketch goes to those two original creators.</br>
